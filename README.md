To load this project on your local machine with Eclipse, go to File -> New -> Java Project. Then uncheck Use default location and set your Location to your path to this repository folder on your local machine (e.g. /path/to/advancedRaytracer).

To run this program, you have to set Run configuration on Eclipse:

Go to Run -> Run configuration, in Main tab, set project to this advancedRaytracer project and set Main class as ray2.RayTracer.

Then go to Argument tab, you can put any XML files from data/scenes/ray2/ (e.g. bunny-norms-aa-spotlight.xml) in Program arguments. 

Then a PNG image file will be created with the same name as XML file, but of course with .PNG extension.
