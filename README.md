# advancedRaytracer

To run this program, you have to set Run configuration in Eclipse:

Go to Run -> Run configuration, in Main tab, set project to this advancedRaytracer project and set Main class as ray2.RayTracer.
Then go to Argument tab, you can put any XML files from data/scenes/ray2/ (e.g. bunny-norms-aa-spotlight.xml) in Program arguments. 
Then a PNG image file will be created with the same name as XML file, but of course with .PNG extension.

Have fun!
