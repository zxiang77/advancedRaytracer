<!--
A scene for testing glass to be sure the factors add up.
It consists of a glass sphere in a constant-radius environment.  Such a sphere
is invisible, because the reflected and refracted radiance will always add up
to match the background.  However, with a limited maximum depth it will show a
little darkness around the rim, where very long paths become significant.  This
effect is not really visible to the naked eye with the default max depth of 12.
